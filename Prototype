# OmniSense - Assisted Blind Stick

**OmniSense** is an IoT prototype designed to assist visually impaired individuals by detecting obstacles in their path and alerting them with a buzzer. The project aims to enhance independence and safety for the visually impaired by integrating simple yet effective technology.

## Features

- **Obstacle Detection**: The stick uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the user and obstacles. If an object is detected within 30 cm, a buzzer will sound to alert the user.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Distance to the nearest obstacle is displayed through serial communication, making it easy to monitor and debug.

### Future Enhancements
We plan to expand OmniSense with the following features:
- **Bluetooth Prompt**: Allows connection to a smartphone for additional feedback or assistance.
- **Water Detection**: Alerts the user when water is present on the ground.
- **GPS Monitoring**: Provides real-time location tracking for added security.
- **SOS and Threat Alerts**: Emergency notifications and alerts when dangerous situations are detected.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino UNO
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- Battery
- Jumper wires and breadboard


## Setup

1. Connect the **trigpin** of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 4 and the **echopin** to pin 5 on the Arduino UNO.
2. Attach the **buzzer** to pin 3.
3. Use a battery to power the Arduino and components.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
5. Open the Serial Monitor to observe real-time distance measurements.
